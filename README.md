# Week 10 - Technigo bootcamp

# Happy thoughts!

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

We've built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as our own version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it.


## The problem

This week I started the project following the Technigo's instructions about the methodology to achieve the goal. I made a sketch about what kind of components I needed, their responsability and state. Then I started coding and creating the main structure of the components and adding css with fake data. At the end I created the fetch functions and used the useEffect hook to populate the thougths. Finally I add logic to reveal the 'likes' fetching the API every time that a like is made, as we worked with small amount of users and data. In other case I would rather prefer to updated locally first to avoid impact in performance.
