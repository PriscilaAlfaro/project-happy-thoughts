# Week 10 - Technigo bootcamp

# Happy thoughts!

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

We've built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as our own version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it.


## Usage

1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
2. Start the project: `npm start`
